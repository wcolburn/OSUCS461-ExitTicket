	When a .pth file is placed in the site-packages directory,
	Python executes any valid Python code within it.

	In this case, the .pth file will contain

		"import site;site.addsitedir('{project_root}', set());\n",

	so that every time Python is run, the project directory ({project_root})
	will be added to the sys.path for module importing.
